        "## Game Overview\n",
        "Action Castle is a text adventure where you play as a peasant who must navigate through a castle, solve puzzles, and ultimately become the reigning monarch by sitting on the throne.\n",

        "## Complete Win Route\n",
        "1. Get the branch from the tree\n",
        "2. Hit the guard with the branch (subdues guard)\n",
        "3. Go east to feasting hall, get the candle\n",
        "4. Light the candle\n",
